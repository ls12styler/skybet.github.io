summary:    How we changed our team structures for the better.
---

As was [previously metnioned](http://engineering.skybettingandgaming.com/colin's-post-here), a variety of people from around the technology side of the business attended [Veolcity Conf](http://conferences.oreilly.com/velocity) back at the end of October. Many thoughts and ideas were brought back from Amsterdam that have fueled many conversations I've been a part of since. Many of these conversations have revolved around how we structure our teams and how we can make them better.

Since I first started around 4 years ago, one thing Sky Betting & Gaming have truley not been afraid of is change. We've changed internally more times than I have fingers and toes. Sky Betting & Gaming adopted the [Spotify Tribal Model](https://labs.spotify.com/2014/03/27/spotify-engineering-culture-part-1/) almosy 2 and a half years ago, and for the most part, this has been a huge success. However there are still a couple of areas we need to get better at (continous improvement anyone?). This enabled the ever-growing Betting and Gaming sides of the business split into more autonomous departments and teams. We created squads for each area of focus, and this is where I come in, being an engineer and all.

I'm currently the Principal Engineer for the [Sky Vegas](https://www.skyvegas.com) Squad. The Vegas Squad was started when we first split into Tribes & Squads and at the time I was the technical lead for the [Sky Casino](https://www.skycasino.com) Squad. For the first year, things remained realtively the same. As we delivered the Sky Casino product in it's intial form, we decided to merge the Casino Squad with our Poker & Bingo Squad, so I moved to being the technical lead for the Vegas Squad. Towards the beginning of 2015, Sky Betting & Gaming became an idependent company. This started a huge focus on growing the business, something I've had the pelasure of being part of. As the Vegas Squad ran with creating the new Sky Vegas website from scratch at the end of 2014, we decided to adopt a microservices architecture right from the beginning. To be able to reach feature parity for desktop & mobile users, there was a lot of work to be done. The project was massive in scope - we had customer facing feature sets to complete, operational management tools to create, monitoring to setup, platforms to scale, you name it. It was going to take a long time.

As the pressure from the business on us to deliver the new proposition grew, so did the Vegas Squad. As we continued to hire many new faces and take on contractors to help bolster the team supporting the delivery of Sky Vegas, we slowly lost sight of what the tribal model meant. The Vegas Squad grew to harbouring over 20 people, including Scrum Master, Business Analyst, UX/UI/Designers, Front-end Developers, Testers, Engineers and a Solutions Architecht. Running the traditional SCRUM ceremonies started to include an ever increasing list of attendees. This made planning difficult, having 15 very smart and opioniated people present trying to come to one, widely accepted soltion took a while and often I had to 'put my foot down' and make the decision for us (NOTE: This doesn't happen often and we gernerally encourage collaborative solutions and designs). You know what they say though, '9 women don't make a baby in a month' and throwing more resource at a project when it isn't progressing as fast as you would like can have a negative effect in productivity as you bring the newbies up to speed.

Over the last couple of months, I've been in conversations with the Engineering Manager & other Principal Engineers within the Gaming Tribe around how we best structure our Squads in order to support further growth and the number of products/supporting applications. Taking lessons from [Mike Amundsen's Talk at Velocity Amsterdam 2015](http://conferences.oreilly.com/velocity/devops-web-performance-eu-2015/public/schedule/detail/44500) and going back to our tribal organisation,
